//this app is a simple app that demonstrates that we are able to deploy 
//to our iPad and android emulator--Android blows as well as its emulator
//of course so does titanium.  If your paying attention this is my opinion
//as was asked for during the go to training
//this app needs to be a simple single page application that needs to include
//my name and course month this is almost a waste of needing 2 code files as 
//the app shouldnt even hit 50 lines of code.

//include our ui.js
